<p>It is currently 495°C and my sandwich is melting<br>I did a few more tests and found that the universal boiling point for a cheese sandwich is 486°C<br>Curiously however it seems that a humble pickle sandwich has a much lower boiling point at 393°C</p>

<p>Thanks to my total lack of social life and an alarming amount of free time I managed to create a list of all of the melting points for sandwiches;</p>

<p>Peanut butter and jam sandwich: 370°C
<br>Marmite sandwich: 385°C
<br>Pickle sandwich: 393°C 
<br>BLT sandwich: 460°C
<br>Cheese sandwich: 486°C 
<br>Bacon sandwich: 515°C
<br>Ham sandwich: 520°C
<br>Club sandwich: 633°C
<br>Knuckle sandwich: 854°C
