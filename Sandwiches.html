		<h1>Mmm sandwiches</h1>

		<p><a href="index.html">Main page</a></p>

		<p>It is currently 495&#248;C and my sandwich is melting<br>I did a few more tests and found that the universal boiling point for a cheese sandwich is 486&#248;C<br>Curiously however it seems that a humble pickle sandwich has a much lower boiling point at 393&#248;C</p>

		<p>Thanks to my total lack of social life and an alarming amount of free time I managed to create a list of all of the melting points for sandwiches;</p>

		<p>Peanut butter and jam sandwich: 370&#248;C
		<br>Marmite sandwich: 385&#248;C
		<br>Pickle sandwich: 393&#248;C 
		<br>BLT sandwich: 460&#248;C
		<br>Cheese sandwich: 486&#248;C 
		<br>Bacon sandwich: 515&#248;C
		<br>Ham sandwich: 520&#248;C
		<br>Club sandwich: 633&#248;C
		<br>Knuckle sandwich: 854&#248;C
