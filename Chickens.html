<h1>History of chickens in csgo </h1>

<p><a href="index.html">Main page</a></p>

<p> Chickens are an essential part of any typical persons gaming experience on a csgo server.
<br>Roaming around and randomly spawning, chickens have been the subject of many festive updates over the years, starting with the Halloween update of 2013,
<br>putting the little avians in white bed sheet ghost costumes, they have also been given christmas jumpers, pumpkin heads, antlers and more.
<br>The most impressive change came on Halloween 2014 when the patch notes ominously said "When theres no more room in cjicken hell...". players soon descovered
<br>that after being killed the chickens would rise from the dead to haunt the battlefield.</p>

<p>Fun fact: In Deathmatch, when killed a chicken will give you one point, meaning that it is possible yet still unreasonable to use our feathered friends as 
<br>a somewhat cruel "passive" option to actually playing the game as it was intended.</p>

<p>In early 2015 a henhouse was added to the Inferno maps T-spawn and players were given the option to tame one of their own, walking up to a chicken and 
<br>pressing "E" will make the chicken follow you until death does you part, even telepiorting back to your spawn if they survive the round. If your chicken 
<br>accomplice doesnt make it *sob* a message will be displayed in the chat letting you know of the sad news.</p>

<p>Binding a key on your keyboard to "give chicken" allows you to cover whole surfaces with them.</p>
<p>Press ~ key to get into the console and use this command:  bind <Key> give chicken</p>
